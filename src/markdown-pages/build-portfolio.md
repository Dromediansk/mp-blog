Creating personal portfolio page has never been easier than it is today. You will only need to have knowledge of HTML, CSS and primarily - right sources. The truth is these kind of pages have to look nice to give positive first impression, nothing else. If you have experience with some of the Javascript frameworks (React, Angular, etc..), it's certainly beneficial, but not required. If you look at the purpose of such project, it is mostly targeted on junior developers, who seek new job opportunities or who want to put online their résumé and make new social connections. **Though the biggest side-effect is that you will also practice coding skills, deployment process and lastly get basic knowledge in design and marketing.**

First and foremost I'd like to notify that following content is based on my own experience, which I obtained during creation of my personal portfolio page [miroslavpillar.com](https://www.miroslavpillar.com).  Altough it's not perfect, I was trying to make it simple, responsive and at the same time - learn a bunch of new stuff. It was built with React and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), which I highly recommend to use for this case. If you think you still don't have enough experience to build whole page, you can read my guide about [how to approach learning web development without science degree](https://blog.miroslavpillar.com/web-development-guide/).

### 1.tip - Purpose of the page

Now you are thinking: 'Isn't the purpose already obvious?' Well, if you want to have modern page, you have to look into it more deeper. Try to ask yourself these questions:

1. Whom is page adressed? Potential employers? Or another customers?
2. What will be the main content? Your best projects? Your products or services? Or your life journey?

Feel free to take your time and clarify answers on these questions. Don't hesitate to take a note and write it down. It is crucial to demonstrate visitors, what is the page about.
