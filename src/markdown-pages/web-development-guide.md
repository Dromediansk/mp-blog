Many people are not fulfilled by their current job and they are searching for a change, but struggling where to start these days.

There are also people, who want to become developers one day, but are discouraged by thinking they don’t have enough skills or computer science degree.

I was also one of them. But I can tell you a story, how I changed my career path. And you can do that, too.

_This article is first and foremost dedicated to people who want to get hired as web developers, junior developers or people who are searching for inspiration :)_

### A little word about me

Okay, that’s a nice word for the start, but who am I actually and why should you even trust me?

I’d like to introduce myself, so you have a basic picture about author of this story. Feel free to skip this part if you’re not interested.

My name is Miroslav Pillar and I come from Slovakia (EU). I work as full-time Javascript software developer in IT consultant company from May 2019. I mainly focus on frontend applications using React.

I am also giving an effort to actively contribute on various private projects. You can view some of them on my website [miroslavpillar.com](https://miroslavpillar.com).

For me, achievements mentioned above are already a great success — moreover because my educational background is in regional development and economics studies at Masaryk University in Brno (CZ).

_So I have degree, which is completely out of field where I’m working now._

### Motivation as a first pillar of success

I want to point out that following ideas are purely subjective and are inspired from my own experience.
In my case it all started when I was studying economics at university.
I couldn’t imagine, which full-time job would suit me and I was studying just because I had to.
However, I discovered inspirational youtube channels to find new point of view and move on. [Michael Valmont](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD-cyDCJUs80NGUCYTCVPDA) had created most useful videos I have ever came across — among other things — about [Will Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CbMDE1ZzHA) and [Connor McGregor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrYv01Z1Hek).

**I believe it's truly important to have your own model to stay motivated in long-term.** It can help you approach problems and get inspiration how successful people deal with similar situations.

It's worth to mention channel [Actualized.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgeicB5AuF3MyyUto0-M5Lw), which is about understanding of human mind and psychology. I appreciate especially honest and straightforward explanations.

### Life after study

After finishing school usually comes doubtful question to ourselves _“what about now?”_

In my case I got an offer to work as technical support in one IT company, where I worked for 2 years. I didn’t have any technical background, but I can speak English and German, which was my huge advantage. I realized, that **language skills are highly valuated by employers and if you know some, you are drastically increasing chances to get a decent job.** I am sure, my country is not the only example.

After some time I realised, I couldn’t do technical support my whole life. Therefore I started to dig into programming and enrolled in courses about HTML, CSS and Javascript from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which I can highly recommend for the start.

There are also a lot of video tutorials on Youtube you can watch, e.g. from [mmtuts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzyuZJ8zZ-Lhfnz41DG5qLw) and [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA). If you want to build real projects, but don’t feel confident about it, [freecodecamp on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) has many great tutorials how to do it from scratch.

All for free.

### Learning the whole ecosystem

After tutorials mentioned above I knew only particles without whole ecosystem. I didn’t feel confident to build a complex project alone or even apply for a web developer job.

If you feel similarly, don’t worry. It’s pretty usual feeling in this stage of learning.

In my case, the holes started to fulfill (and also overflow!) when I enrolled to the most complex web course **_[The Complete Web Developer — Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) led by really authentic teacher Andrei Neagoie_**. You will learn fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript, understand React JS and how it works and also get to know backend — particularly how to build server with Node JS and PostgreSQL database. The final project of the course is full-stack face recognition app and this is my [version](https://flamboyant-curie-74af2f.netlify.com).

Besides the course you should start to **build your own projects and Google or Stackoverflow should become your best friends.** If you get stuck with some technical problem — search or ask! Most likely there is already someone who had solved the same problem.

I guarantee, you will be truly proud on yourself after building your own stuff.

To summarize the point, try to put yourself in employer's shoes. If you would seek new developers, would you give a chance to applicant who is actively building his portfolio and contributing on open-source projects? I would.

After finishing the course I enrolled to another from the same teacher [The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/), which totally opened my eyes to the ecosystem. You will enhance your skills especially in terms of perfomance, security and devops.

In the meantime of learning from videos and building staff, you should **start to apply for a job.**

I had few interviews I didn't succeed, but as time passed by, I realized these interviews and technical questions gave me irreplaceable experience, so I knew where I had shortcomings. **Don't be discouraged if they say no, but benefit from the experience.**

In my case, after three rounds of technical interview on one job position I have finally succeeded.

### The dark side

Of course I had days I stopped learning and impostor syndrome played his role (and sometimes still does). Or I wasn't able to solve difficult technical problem. Or I was exerting pressure on myself to suck all the knowledge out there. But nobody is perfect and knows everything, especially in this field.

I gave it time and I knew, what is my goal and why I want to do it. I also knew, what I don't want to do. **There is an article [how to deal with problems as a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/), which I highly recommend!**

So again - motivation is always crucial factor in this play. **Try to set up a routine and code regularly (at least 5 times a week)**, e.g. solve algorithms, contribute on projects or just sharpen your skills by watching videos about new technologies. I am sure results will soon arrive :)

### Summary

Learning web development is hard - but that is also a reason why is well paid. I believe it has a bright future. It's one of the few fields where you don't need computer science degree to get hired.

With Javascript you can build pretty much anything - from frontend with [libraries or frameworks](https://www.javascripting.com/) - to backend with Node server - until [building robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_r7UBBp8pE).

To sum things up, here are the five steps how you should approach to learn (not only) coding, be attractive for employers and not get overwhelmed:

1. **_Motivation_** - have your own model to stay motivated in long-term
2. **_Regularity_** - code and learn new technologies at least 4-5 days a week
3. **_Creativity_** - build your own projects. Employers appreciate practical experience. I would be keen to invite someone on interview, who contributes in open-source projects.
4. **_Effectivity_** - don't solve excessively hard problems for many hours. Simplify things by dividing problems into smaller parts. Use google, because most likely someone had solved this problem before. And if not, ask!
5. **_Relax_** - try to not burn out. It's okay to have a break for few days and continue if you have apetite for coding again.

Thank you for reading and stay sharp!

Miroslav
