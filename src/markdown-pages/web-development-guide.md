I see many smart people who are not fulfilled by their current job and they are searching for a change, but struggling where to start these days. Or people, who want to become developers one day, but are discouraged they don't have enough skills or computer science degree. Well, you came to right place for finding new inspiration or obtain another sources for (personal) development.

This article is first and foremost dedicated to people who want to get hired as web developers, junior developers or people who are searching for inspiration :)

### A little word about me

Okay, that's a nice word for the start. But who am I actually? I'd like to introduce myself, so you know, whom are you reading about. If you are not interested, feel free to skip this part.

My name is Miroslav Pillar and I come from small city of Kosice in Slovakia (middle Europe). I work as full-time Javascript software developer in IT consultant company from May 2019. I mainly focus on frontend using React. I am also giving an effort to actively contribute on open-source projects on GitHub or to build personal projects. I've finished regional development and economics studies at Masaryk University in Brno (CZ). So I have degree, which is completely out of field where I'm working now, but I can tell, it has its advantages. You can read my resume on [miroslavpillar.com/resume](https://miroslavpillar.com/resume).

### Motivation as a first pillar of success

_For the start, I would like to point out that following ideas are purely subjective and I am drawing ideas only from my experience up to now, so feel free to make your own decisions and opinions._

It all started, when I was studying at university. I couln't imagine, which full-time job would suit me and I was just studying, because I had to. However, I started to browse youtube channels (besides playing video games and hanging out) to find new point of view and move on. I think [Michael Valmont](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD-cyDCJUs80NGUCYTCVPDA) had created most useful videos I have ever came across - among other things - about [Will Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CbMDE1ZzHA) and [Connor McGregor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrYv01Z1Hek). 

I believe it's truly important to have your own model to stay motivated in long-term. It can help you approach problems and get inspiration how successful people deal with similar situations.

It's worth to mention channel [Actualized.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgeicB5AuF3MyyUto0-M5Lw), which is about understaning of human mind and psychology. I appreciate especially honest and straightforward explanations. On the other hand some ideas could be controversial for someone.

### Life after study

After finishing school usually comes doubtful question to ourselves _"what now?"_ In my case I got an offer to work as technical support in one IT company, where I worked for 2 years. I didn't have any technical background, but I can speak English and German, which was my huge advantage. I realized, that language skills are highly valuated by employers and if you know some, you are drastically increasing chances to get a decent job. I am sure, my country is not the only example.

Altough the job was not repulsive, I couldn't do technical support my whole life. I started to digging into programming and enrolled in courses about HTML, CSS and Javascript from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which are totally free. There are also a lot of videos on Youtube you can watch, f.e. from [mmtuts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzyuZJ8zZ-Lhfnz41DG5qLw) and [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA). If you want to build real projects, but don't feel confident about it, [freecodecamp on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) has many great tutorials how to do it from scratch. All for free.

If you come from Slovakia, I can highly recommend course [Webrebel](https://www.learn2code.sk/kurzy/webrebel-1-html-css-javascript) thanks to learn2code.sk.

### Learning the whole ecosystem

> "The strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything. The weakness is that you will."
> – Reg Braithwaite

After tutorials mentioned above I knew only particles without whole ecosystem. I didn't feel confident to build a complex project alone or apply for a web developer job. The holes started to fulfill (and also overflow!) when I enrolled to the most complex web course [The Complete Web Developer - Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) led by truly great and authentic teacher Andrei Neagoie. You will learn fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript, understand [React]((https://reactjs.org/)) and how it works and also get to know backend - namely NodeJS and PostgreSQL database. The final project was full-stack based [face recognition app](https://sharp-shockley-0c9ce8.netlify.com/). 

Besides the course you should start to build your own projects and Google will become your best friend. My first React project was [Star Wars Scout](https://dromediansk.github.io/star-wars-scout/), in which you can find basic info about your favourite character. I spent several weeks by creating my own [portfolio](https://miroslavpillar.com/) in React and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and also started to contribute on open-source projects, f. e. [ZeroToMastery](https://zerotomastery.io/) or [Fullstacktrends](https://www.fullstacktrends.com/) created by ZTM community. I guarantee, you will be truly proud on yourself after building your own stuff.

To summarize the point, try to put yourself in employer's shoes. If you would seek new developers, would you give a chance to applicant who is actively building his portfolio and contributing on open-source projects? I would.

After finishing the course I enrolled to another from the same teacher [The Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-junior-to-senior-web-developer-roadmap/), which totally opened my eyes to the ecosystem. You will enhance your skills especially in terms of perfomance, security and [devops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps).

> "Wether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right."
> – Henry Ford

In the meantime of learning from videos and building staff, you should start to apply for a job. I had a few interviews I didn't succeed, but as time passed by, I realized these interviews and technical questions gave me irreplaceable experience, so I knew where I had shortcomings. So don't be discouraged if they say no, but benefit from the experience.

In my case, after three rounds of technical interview on one job position I have finally succeeded.

### The dark side

Of course I had days I stopped learning and [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) played his role (and sometimes still does). Or I wasn't able to solve hard technical problem. Or I was exerting pressure on myself to suck all the knowledge out there. But nobody is perfect and knows everything, especially in this field. I gave it time and I knew, what is my goal and why I want to do it. I also knew, what I don't want to do. There is an article [how to deal with problems as a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/), which I highly recommend! 

So again - motivation is always crucial factor in this play. Since last year I am trying to code regularly (at least 5 times a week) - solve algorhitms, contribute on projects or just sharpening my skills by watching videos about new technologies. You need to set up your daily routine, get used to and results will soon arrive :)

### Summary

Learning web development is hard, but that is also a reason why is well paid and I believe it has a bright future. It's one of the few fields where you don't need computer science degree to get hired. With Javascript you can build pretty much anything - from frontend with [libraries or frameworks](https://www.javascripting.com/) - to backend with Node server - until [building robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_r7UBBp8pE).

To sum things up, here are the five steps how you should approach to learn (not only) coding, be attractive for employers and not be overwhelmed:

1. _Motivation_ - have your own model to stay motivated in long-term
2. _Regularity_ - code and learn new technologies at least 4-5 days a week
3. _Creativity_ - build your own projects. Employers appreciate practical experience. I would be keen to invite someone on interview, who contributes in open-source projects.
4. _Effectivity_ - don't solve excessively hard problems for many hours. Simplify things by dividing problems into smaller parts. Use google, because most likely someone had solved this problem before. And if not, ask!
5. _Relax_ - try to not burn out. It's okay to have a break for few days and continue if you have apetite for coding again.

Thank you for reading and stay sharp!
