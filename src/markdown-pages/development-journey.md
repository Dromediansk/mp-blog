You are asking yourself, why you should read this article and why you should even care. However, I see many people with great potential who are not filled by their current job and they are searching for a change, but don't know, where to start. I hope this is a proper place for finding another motivation and maybe learn something new.

Okay, that's a nice word for the introduction. But who am I actually? If you are not interested, feel free to skip this part. Otherwise, I'd like to introduce myself, so you know, whom are you reading about. My name is Miroslav Pillar and I come from small city of Kosice in Slovakia (middle Europe). I work as full-time Javascript Software developer (mainly focusing on frontend) in IT consultant company from Germany. I am also giving an effort to actively contribute on open-source projects on GitHub or to build personal projects.

For the start, I would like to point out that following ideas are purely subjective and I am drawing ideas only from my experience up to now, so please don't judge and feel free to make your own opinions.
